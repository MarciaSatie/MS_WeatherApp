**event.currentTarget.id**(at dashboard.njk) this will return the value from the ID from teh module related to action click (at this case <a>).
event -> carries all the information from action click and it is passed as a parameter inside of the function myFunction
reference: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/currentTarget

**Tenary Expression**(at preference.njk) Just a simpler and easy to read way to write if and else. I particularly I like, and I am trying to use it more.
reference: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Conditional_operator

**JSON.parse and JSON Strigfy**(at preference.njk) As adding direct the array to localStorage will transform everything in a unique string, I need somethinf that will tranform all array's code ina  string. 
reference: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-store-an-array-in-localstorage/

**Regex** (at file: header.njk): Regular expression, with a partten of cahracters, allowed me to take of specific characters from a string, using .replace()
reference: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_expressions/Character_classes
 https://www.debuggex.com/cheatsheet/regex/javascript

 ````
regex : /\/+$/ => 
/content/ -> what is between slashes will be count in cosideration for regex .
\/+ ->  To match this / character literally (thsi what I want to get rid off) , escape it with itself. In other words to search for \ use \// (+ -> 1 more, at this case to repit "/" to achive \//).
$ -> end of the string
